# Running Voyant Tools Locally

As an alternative to using the Voyant Tools website, you can run an instance of Voyant on your own computer.

The benefits of this include:
* You can keep your texts confidential as our server will not cache your work.
* You can restart the server if it slows down or crashes.
* You can handle large texts without the connection timing out.
* You can work offline (without an Internet connection).
* You can have a group of users (like in a workshop or class) run their own instance without encountering load issues on our server.
