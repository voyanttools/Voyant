# Constellations

Constellations produces a specialized network graph of high frequency terms that are connected by similar word vectors.

Use it with a <a href="../?view=Constellations&corpus=austen" target="_blank">Jane Austen corpus</a> or with <a href="../?view=Constellations" target="_blank">your own corpus</a>.

## Overview

Although making use of the same dimension reduction algorithms that underlie the [ScatterPlot]{@tutorial scatterplot}, Constellations presents this vector data in a different manner. Connections are created between terms whose vectors are below the Similarity Threshold.
